                        etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or
                        exits. The reason for termination is passed to the handler.
                        The Pod''s termination grace period countdown begins before
                        the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome
                        of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within
                        the Pod''s termination grace period. Other management of the
                        container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination
                        grace period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks'

                                as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.
